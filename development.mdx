Step 1. Generate types and Hyperuser export that can be imported anywhere in your React codebase

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript
export interface EmbedProps {
   disabled?: boolean;
   darkMode?: boolean;
   userId: string;
   apiKey: string;
   user: any;
}
type Hyperuser = {
   initialize(params: EmbedProps): void;
   track(eventName: string): void;
   /** * Starts a new deployment with the specified deployment ID. * @param deploymentId - The unique identifier of the deployment. */ startDeployment(
      deploymentId: string
   ): void;
};
const errorBoundary = (functionToExcecute: Function) => {
   if (typeof window === "undefined") return;
   if (!(window as any).hyperuser) {
      console.warn("[hyperuser]: You tried to initialize hyperuser before the script tag was loaded.");
      return;
   }
   try {
      functionToExcecute();
   } catch {
      console.warn("There was an error excuting a function");
   }
};
class hyperuser implements Hyperuser {
   initialize(props: EmbedProps) {
      return errorBoundary((window as any)?.hyperuser?.initialize(props));
   }
   startDeployment(deploymentId: string) {
      return errorBoundary((window as any)?.hyperuser?.startDeployment(deploymentId));
   }
   track(eventId: string) {
      return;
   }
}
export default new hyperuser();


```

```javascript Javascript
const errorBoundary = functionToExcecute => {
  if (typeof window === "undefined") return
  if (!window.hyperuser) {
    console.warn(
      "[hyperuser]: You tried to initialize hyperuser before the script tag was loaded."
    )
    return
  }
  try {
    functionToExcecute()
  } catch {
    console.warn("There was an error excuting a function")
  }
}
class hyperuser {
  initialize(props) {
    return errorBoundary(window?.hyperuser?.initialize(props))
  }
  startDeployment(deploymentId) {
    return errorBoundary(window?.hyperuser?.startDeployment(deploymentId))
  }
  track(eventId) {
    return
  }
}
export default new hyperuser()

```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Add script tag

```html
<script type="module" src="https://widget.holyuser.com/holyuser.js"></script>
```

Step 3. Initialize hyperuser client

```javascript
hyperuser.initialize({
    darkMode: false,
    userId: "<any-unique-id>",
    apiKey: "<your-api-key>",
    user: {
        // any information you want to query against
        firstName: "<user-first-name>",
        email: "<user-email>"
    },
});
```


### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://widget.holyuser.com/holyuser.js"></script>
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Startup
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing)
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify is not loading">
    Update to Node v18. Run `mintlify install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No such file or directory on Windows">
Go to the `C:/Users/Username/.mintlify/` directory and remove the `mint`
folder. Then Open the Git Bash in this location and run `git clone
https://github.com/mintlify/mint.git`.

Repeat step 3.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting an unknown error">
    Try navigating to the root of your device and delete the ~/.mintlify folder.
    Then run `mintlify dev` again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
